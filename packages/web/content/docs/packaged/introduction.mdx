### Coming soon

We're busy making Realtime awesome right now, and we'll get around to this as soon as we can.


### What it is 

Supabase Packaged is simply PostgreSQL, with all the common plugins you may need as well as a few bells-and-whistles we think you may need. 
We wrap it all up to make it easy to deploy to various platforms.

### How it works

It's pretty simple, we just PostgreSQL and various other tools into packages for usage with:

- Containers: Docker & Kubernetes
- More coming soon


### What it isn't 

It's not a replacement for your full production instance.

### Features

- 100% open source
- Restful Admin interface for interacting with your database schema (listing tables, views, settings, etc)
- Master replication enabled by default
- Plugins: PostGIS, TimescaleDb, wal2json 

### Benefits

- Get up and running quickly
- Try out PostgreSQL plugins without having to go through painful installations
- Best practices implemented out-of-the-box
