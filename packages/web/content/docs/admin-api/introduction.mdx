### Coming soon

We're busy making Realtime awesome right now, and we'll get around to this as soon as we can.

### What it is 

Superbase Admin API is a RESTful interface for interacting with your database schema (listing tables, views, settings, etc).

### How it works

We took all the common SQL commands that we think you'd need, and we put a RESTful interface in front of them.


### What it isn't 

It's not for interacting with your data - it for querying the schema (tables, views) and database (settings).

### Features

- 100% open source
- Built with JS, can be used on the client (web, mobile)

### Benefits

- Familiar
- Quick
- and Dirty
