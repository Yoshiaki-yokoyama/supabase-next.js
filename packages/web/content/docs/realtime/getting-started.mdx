Supabase Realtime is an elixir server that allows you to listen to PostgreSQL inserts/updates/deletes over websockets.

## Motivation

Change data capture solves a lot of tough engineering problems related to stale data. On top of that, some systems (like chat apps) require realtime data. 
Supabase Realtime is designed to solve these problems and be usable anywhere from mobile, web, and other servers.

## How it works

The server is built with [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/), which is an Elixir framework that's amazing for listening via websockets. 
The Phoenix server listens to PostgreSQL's replication functionality and converts the byte stream into JSON. Tt then broadcasts the JSON over websockets. 
This is great since you can scale the Phoenix servers without any additional load on your DB. 

The great thing about this implementation is that you can make changes to your database from anywhere - your api, directly in the DB, via a console etc - 
and you will still receive the changes via Realtime.

## What this isn't 

We are building the client libraries which make it super simple to connect to the server. 
However we don't intend to build client-side databases that can do all the offline conflict resolution that other services like Firebase provide.

Supabase Realtime is a passive listen/broadcast system. You don't use it to make updates to your database.

- Works without wal2json :)
