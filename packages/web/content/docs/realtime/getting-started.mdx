Supabase Realtime is an elixir server that allows you to listen to PostgreSQL inserts/updates/deletes over websockets.

## How it works

Realtime listens to PostgreSQL's replication functionality and converts the byte stream into JSON. It then broadcasts the JSON over websockets. 

It is built with [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/), an Elixir framework that's incredibly scalable. 

The great thing about this implementation is that you can make changes to your database from anywhere - your API, directly in the DB, via a console etc - 
and you will still receive the changes via Realtime.

You can also scale the Phoenix servers without any additional load on your DB.

## What this isn't 

We are building the client libraries which make it super simple to connect to the server. 
However we don't intend to build client-side databases that can do all the offline conflict resolution that other services like Firebase provide.

Supabase Realtime is a passive listen/broadcast system. You don't use it to make updates to your database.

## Features

- 100% open source
- Accessible by mobile and web
- Works without wal2json :)

## Benefits

- You own your data. Realtime can be pointed at any PostgreSQL database that has replication enabled.
- Build chat apps and other systems that require realtime functionality.
- Listening to data changes on client side solves stale data problems and update collisions.
- Many systems that give you realtime functionality require you to update via the same interface that the listener is on. Supabase is source agnostic. Update your database from anywhere and you'll still get the changes.
