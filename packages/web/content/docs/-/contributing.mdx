## Want to contribute?

So ... we're even looking for contributions on our contributions guidelines. 

Supabase is thinking in public. Everything is online, no matter how raw the current state of things. 

We'll make this awesome we promise, but if you can't wait then why not jump into our github and:

- submit an issue
- create a pull request
- try one of our products and give feedback
